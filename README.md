ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, thanks for stopping by! 
My GitHub profile is currently undergoing some updates, but I'll be back with new and exciting projects soon.

In the meantime, let me introduce myself. My name is Abbie, and I'm a mobile engineer with 3+ years of experience developing cross-platform mobile applications. While my core skills are in Dart/Flutter, I've recently become interested in Swift. Perhaps it's my inner iOS fangirl coming out! 

When I'm not coding, you can find me re-watching episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S or teaching my dog new tricks.

I'm looking forward to sharing my latest creations with you soon!
